# GW_dark_sirens
This repository encompasses the procedures for acquiring key ingredients and parameter values utilized in MontePython for gravitational wave (GW) simulations, particularly focusing on Dark Sirens. It also contains comprehensive information about the configuration of every simulation employed during my Master's thesis at RWTH Aachen University, where I conducted research under the guidance of Professor Dr. Julien Lesgourgues.

The provided notebooks elucidate the meticulous methodology for extracting the number density distribution of GWs.

Moreover, the primary objective of this repository is to house the simulation results for the MCMC analysis conducted in the author's thesis, as well as the forthcoming publication. Each file includes an exhaustive documentation, offering an in-depth explanation of every name employed. Specifically, for each simulation run, users can access the extracted plots, the results from each MCMC chain, the parameter names, the best-fit values, the progression of the jumping factor, the final jumping factor, and the parameter file. The latter is of paramount importance as it delineates the prior constraints applied to each specific run, along with the parameters that users have the flexibility to modify.
