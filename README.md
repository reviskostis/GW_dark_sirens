# GW_dark_sirens
This repository contains the procedure for obtaining key ingredients and parameter values for the MCMC simulations with Montepython for GW and more precisely Dark Sirens. It contains also the details for the setup of every simulation used during my Master's thesis at RWTH Aachen University, where I worked under the supervision of Prof.Dr. Julien Lesgourgues. The provided notebooks present the methodology of the extraction of GW number density distribution.
