In all other instances, the non-linear power spectrum extracted from CLASS is employed.

Moreover, we specify the particular GW dataset in the following manner:

"ET1" denotes the dataset for one year of observation assuming the Einstein Telescope.
"ET10" corresponds to the dataset for ten years of observation with the Einstein Telescope.
Please note that in this context, the choice of the GW dataset is critical isn. 
Additionally, it informs the binning assumption and the priors established.


For each run, a covmat, generated by preceding runs, is supplied to enhance the convergence of subsequent runs.

On occasion, two runs are necessary to achieve convergence and create the covmats, which are then utilized in the second runs.

In this file we ar using only the one GW part of the covmat, while in the file named total_covmat we are using the the total covmat.
