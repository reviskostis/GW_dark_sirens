In all other instances, the non-linear power spectrum extracted from CLASS is employed.

Moreover, we specify the particular GW dataset in the following manner:

"ET1" denotes the dataset for one year of observation assuming the Einstein Telescope.
"ET10" corresponds to the dataset for ten years of observation with the Einstein Telescope.
Please note that in this context, the choice of the GW dataset is not critical. However, it informs the binning assumption and the priors established.

In cases where a specific dataset is not explicitly mentioned, the HLVIK dataset is the default selection.

For each run, a covmat, generated by preceding runs, is supplied to enhance the convergence of subsequent runs.

On occasion, two runs are necessary to achieve convergence and create the covmats, which are then utilized in the second runs.
