In all other cases, the non-linear power spectrum derived from CLASS is utilized.

Furthermore, we denote the specific GW dataset as follows:

"ET1" corresponds to the dataset for a one-year observation with the Einstein Telescope.
"ET10" represents the dataset for a ten-year observation with the Einstein Telescope.
When a specific dataset is not explicitly mentioned, the HLVIK dataset is the default choice.

Each run is equipped with a covmat, generated by previous runs, to expedite the convergence of subsequent runs.

Occasionally, two runs are required to achieve convergence and create the covmats, which are subsequently utilized in the second runs.

The runs here involve the use of two auto-correlation probes and the pure cross-correlation, all executed simultaneously. 
This necessitated the repetition of the same code and corresponding Montepython setup three times.
Consequently, these runs were approximately three times slower than the rest.
Nevertheless, the same priors were applied uniformly across all runs
