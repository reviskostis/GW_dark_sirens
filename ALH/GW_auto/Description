In all other instances, the non-linear power spectrum extracted from CLASS is employed.

We specify the particular GW dataset as follows:

"ET1" denotes the dataset for one year of observation, assuming the Einstein Telescope.
"ET10" corresponds to the dataset for ten years of observation with the Einstein Telescope.
It's worth noting that the choice of the GW dataset is pivotal in this context, 
as it influences the binning assumption and the established priors.

In cases where a specific dataset is not explicitly mentioned, the HLVIK dataset serves as the default selection,
and we've placed it in a separate file for your convenience.

For each run, a covmat, generated by preceding runs, is provided to expedite the convergence of subsequent runs.

In some instances, two runs are required to achieve convergence and create the covmats, which are subsequently utilized in the second runs.

The term "correct sigmas" signifies that we adjusted the sigma values in the param file, which can be verified in the log.param file. 
This adjustment was necessary after some runs with a relatively good covmat suggestion failed to converge.

Additionally, there is a run named "super optimistic," which assumes the detection error of GW mergers 
to be significantly less than the default assumption of 20%.
