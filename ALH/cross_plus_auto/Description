The file "linear power spectrum" pertains to a run conducted with the linear power spectrum obtained from CLASS. 
All other runs utilize the non-linear power spectrum extracted from CLASS.

Furthermore, the specific GW dataset used is defined as follows: 
ET1 represents the dataset for one year of observation assuming the Einstein Telescope, 
while ET10 corresponds to the dataset for ten years of observation with the Einstein Telescope.

    
In cases where no dataset is explicitly mentioned, the HLVIK dataset is employed.

For each run, a covmat, generated by previous runs, is provided to expedite the convergence of subsequent runs.
